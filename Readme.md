Why GGN?

In many parts of the world, governments impose strict rules that limit freedom of expression, collaboration, and innovation. Traditional platforms for sharing ideas and solving problems are often monitored, censored, or blocked.

GGN addresses these challenges by providing:

-Decentralization : No central server; data is stored locally in JSON files.
-Anonymity : Users can submit ideas and vote without revealing their identity.
-Accessibility : A lightweight CLI tool that works on any system with Python installed.
-Scalability : Developers can extend GGN into web or mobile applications.
-GGN empowers people to collaborate on solving real-world issues—whether it's climate change, education, healthcare, or social justice—without fear of censorship or surveillance.

Key Features

1. User Registration : Register with just a name and email (optional).
2. Idea Submission : Submit ideas to solve global challenges.
3. Voting System : Vote on ideas to prioritize impactful solutions.
4. Progress Tracking : View the status of ongoing projects and ideas.
5. Local Data Storage : All data is stored in a local JSON file for privacy.
6. Cross-Platform : Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Use Cases

1. Under Political Restrictions

In countries where freedom of speech is limited, GGN allows citizens to anonymously share ideas and collaborate on solutions without fear of government intervention.
Example: A user in a politically restricted country submits an idea for improving access to clean water. Others can vote on it and track its progress.

2. Global Collaboration
GGN connects people from different parts of the world to work together on solving shared challenges.
Example: A developer in Europe teams up with a scientist in Africa to address food insecurity.

3. Community-Led Innovation
Local communities can use GGN to crowdsource solutions for local problems.
Example: A neighborhood uses GGN to gather ideas for reducing waste and improving recycling.

4. Education and Awareness
Educators can use GGN to teach students about problem-solving, collaboration, and civic engagement.
Example: A teacher assigns students to submit ideas for improving their school environment.
